Nemooconfig is a Bash script designed to automate the installation of all the applications I use daily on my Arch Linux machines (btw). Itâ€™s built with flexibility in mind, allowing admins to filter out packages they don't need and even add their own. It also supports multiple languages, including English and Spanish.

## Features

- **Package Filtering**: Choose only the packages you need and skip those you don't.
- **Customization**: Easily add your own packages 
- **Multilanguage Support**: Available in English and Spanish.
- **Ease of Use**: Just run the script and let everything install automatically.

## Requirements

- Arch Linux (btw)
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nemooconfig.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd nemooconfig
   ```
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x nemooconfig.sh
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./nemooconfig.sh
   ```
